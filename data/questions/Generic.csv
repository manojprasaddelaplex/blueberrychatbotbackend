Querying Data: It can fetch records from databases based on your specific requirements (such as referral counts, breach details, presenting complaint breakdowns, and demographic analysis).
Providing Analysis: It can analyze trends (like comparing referral numbers over different periods), project future data (such as estimated future referrals), and calculate service credits.
Offering Summaries: It can summarize data into reports, including average counts, breakdowns by demographic, or time-based trends."
"What permissions do you have?","Based on the queries provided, it appears the system has read-only permissions. It can retrieve (via SELECT) and analyze data from the database tables, but there is no indication of insert (INSERT), update (UPDATE), or delete (DELETE) permissions in the queries provided.
